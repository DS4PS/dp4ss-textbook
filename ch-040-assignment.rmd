## Key Concepts


After reading this chapter you should be able to define the following:

* operators 
* objects
* assignment

```{r, echo=F }

knitr::opts_chunk$set( echo = TRUE, message=F, warning=F, fig.width=8 )

```


```{r, echo=F}
   calcMortgage <- function( principal, years=30, APR=0.05 )
   {

      months <- years * 12
      int.rate <- APR / 12
      
      # amortization formula
      monthly.payment <- ( principal * int.rate ) / 
                         (1 - (1 + int.rate)^(-months) )
      
      monthly.payment <- round( monthly.payment, 2 )
      
      return( monthly.payment )
   
   }
```




```{r, fig.cap="Assignment of output values", echo=F }
knitr::include_graphics( "figures/assignment.png" )
```



## Assignment

When we call a function in R, the default behavior of the function is typically to print the results on the screen:

```{r}
calcMortgage( principal=100000  )
```

If we are creating a script, however, we often need to save the function outputs at each step. We can do this by assigning output to a new variable.

```{r}
payments.15.year <- calcMortgage( years=15, principal=100000  )
payments.30.year <- calcMortgage( years=30, principal=100000  )
```

These values are then stored, and can be used later or printed by typing the object name:

```{r}
payments.15.year
payments.30.year
```

Note that variable names can include periods or underscores. They can also include numbers, but they cannot start with a number. Like everything in R, they will be case sensitive.
