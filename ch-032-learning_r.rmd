## Key Concepts

You will get stuck while learning to code.

## Learning How to Learn



---

Let's begin this chapter by stating and unpacking a few assertions: 

1. Learning R is very similar to learning a spoken language. 
2. Fluency in a programming language is different than fluency in a spoken language.
3. The ultimate end to learning R is to *learn how to learn* so you can quickly master whatever packages are necessary for your current project.

### Similarities Between Human & Machine Languages 

The similarities between human languages (e.g. English, Arabic, Mandarin) and machine languages (e.g. R, Python, JavaScript) are astounding, but a nuanced discussion as to why is beyond the scope of this introduction. 

As examples, however, both human and machine languages:

* Persist or disappear depending on the size of communities that use them
* Derive from older languages and have evolved into new languages
* Differ semantically but are arranged with similar grammatical elements (e.g. nouns, verbs)

<br>

Why is this important? *You learn R the same way you would a foreign language*:

* **Vocabulary:** You need to learn words for things before all else.
* **Reinforcement:** You learn by doing and repeating. 
* **Necessity:** You learn best when success or survival depends on it. 
* **Languages are Social:** You learn faster through collaboration, meetups, forums, conferences.
* **Immersion:** You can't be fluent without being immersed. Get involved in professional and volunteer work, podcasts, and regular reading about your topic.  

If this is your first programming language, you will get frustrated at times. Take a step back and remember that after a semester of Spanish you can only operate at the level of a three-year old. You only know one verb tense, a few dozen verbs, and several hundred words. You can never quite translate all of the ideas 




<br>

<div class="note">

**Fun Fact:** The popular [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) data viz package is based on Leland Wilkinson's framework, "The Grammar of Graphics" (1999), i.e. the `gg` in `ggplot2`. Similarly, the [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) package is described as a "grammar of data manipulation", in which functions are described as "verbs".

</div>

<br>

### You Can't Learn Everything in R (Nor Should You)

There are thousands of R packages. The body of knowledge in the field is growing exponentially. It's impossible (and unnecessary) to learn (or retain) everything the language offers. 



Data science is a fast-moving field of practice. 

* There are tens of thousands of R packages; new ones appear every day.
* Packages and functions are constantly being updated, replaced, consolidated, or deprecated.
* There are nuances to every computational science applied to each natural or social science.


In sum, to remain current in R, one must remain current with... everything.


Accepting these limitations is liberating. It allows one to focus on an *ab initio*, or "first principles" approach to learning R. That is, build solid foundations, then specialize as necessary.

<br>

### The Ultimate Objective: Learning How to Learn R

> "I am always doing that which I cannot do, in order that I may learn how to do it." (Picasso)

There are few telltale signs that you're becoming fluent in R. For example, you may:

* Achieve the same results as your old code with significantly less code
* Use search engines less frequently or not at all while coding
* Be approached by others for collaborative work
* Appraise the quality of code and data products
* Begin dreaming in R (just kidding)

<br>

The ultimate measure of having learned R is to *learn how to learn it*. This is less empirically evident than the above examples, and requires some introspection and emotional awareness to gauge. For instance, imagine you've reached some impasse that the "first principles" approach to R fails to resolve. Do you:

* Pore over online forums? 
* Explore documentation and vignettes?
* Search for packages with potential solutions?
* Boldly install and learn said package(s) without hesitation?
* Recover when fail to resolve the issue? Fail and recover again?
* Remain firm in your conviction that you will resolve the issue?

This is only one of many hypothetical scenarios. Learning how to learn R is not a matter of learning something new everyday (e.g. a function, package, technique, or theory), but the cyclical process of learning in the face of necessity, shoring up your knowledge over some indefinite period, and learning again when the need arises. Above all, you'll know you've learned how to learn R when you no longer doubt your ability to resolve what once seemed impossible.

## Troubleshooting in R

> "The first step in fixing a broken program is getting it to fail repeatably." (Tom Duff)

Your code is going to fail. A lot. We encounter errors all the time. The following is a brief overview for recognizing a problem, as well as myriad strategies to overcome one.

<br>

### Recognizing & Understanding Trouble

Two simple criteria must be met in order to recognize trouble with your code ([Peng et al. 2017](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/RProgDA/)):

1. You expect your code to behave in a certain way
2. Your code doesn't behave as expected

Oftentimes, the best case scenario is that R will throw an **error message**. Error messages signal that R has encountered some fatal flaw in your code and, in consequence, nothing happens.

The next best scenario is that R will throw a **warning message**. Warning messages signal that R has successfully evaluated and executed code, but something unexpected happened, and R wants you to know about it.

The worst and most pernicious scenario is when your code runs perfectly fine, without error or warning messages, yet the output isn't exactly what you'd wanted. If you recognize this, that's great. If you don't recognize this, errors flow downstream and can be difficult to detect and fix. *Always inspect your output*.

<br>

<div class="tip">

**Pro Tip:** Oftentimes, users place too much emphasis on fixing their expected results and fail to consider their original expectations. *Never neglect revisiting your expectations*, as it's possible that they, not your code, may explain an error (ibid.).
